Docker Training Course for the Absolute Beginner

Docker is used to run different container applications to create libs and dependencies without setting up that environment 

The Docker Hub website is essential for finding images of different applications

docker run - it is used to run the docker command or docker images 
docker ps - it is used to display all the information of the container 
docker ps -a (to display all the containers whether they are running or not) 
docker stop [container ID] - to stop running container (it only stops but still present)
docker rm [container ID] - to permanently delete the container
docker images - to list down all the images 
docker rmi - to delete the image 

Docker Run 
How to make docker images interactive use (docker run -it (image_name)) 
docker logs [container_id]

docker run -d [image] - to run in detach mode/background 
docker attach [container ID] - to again run in attach mode 

Docker Images 
Do it practically 

Docker Compose - it is just like shell scripting where you define all the images and containers in yaml file like a database from mongo db website framework from Django in one yaml file 

Do it by building a voting system and other yt projects

Container Orchestration - It is a more advanced and improved version of docker as in docker you have to run multiple images combine them but they become very complex to solve this problem container orchestration (e.g Kubernetes and Docker Swarm ) come in which we can handle multiple images and every cloud provider supports Kubernetes to run different applications  

The main problem with docker is scaling whereas in Kubernetes you can easily scale the application by creating the instances
