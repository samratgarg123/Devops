1 July 2023 - Jenkins / start learn about git also 
Continuous Integration - is just like git clone copy and packing the code then test integration test + security check 
Continuous Delivery(code it still in running process) Deployment (code is deployed)(CICD) - it is the prcosess of deployed the code to docker/ serverless computer 
jenkins is free and open source and jenkins have lots of plugins/ api 
java is required to install jenkins 
To install jenkinks 
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk -y
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo --no-check-certificate
sudo rpm --import http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum install jenkins -y

Jenkins also has GUI to understand the working of the people and ports 
ssh -i /home/mike/.ssh/jenkins_key -l mike -p 8022 jenkins-server help
ssh -i /home/mike/.ssh/jenkins_key -l mike -p 8022 jenkins-server safe-restart
-i flag is used to point to mike's private SSH key. Remember, we have already added the public key in the Jenkins configuration.
-l is the login user which in our example is mike
-p is the port which we found out in the previous step to be 8022

sudo systemctl restart jenkins
systemctl status jenkins

install-plugin disable-plugin 
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8085 -auth 'admin:Adm!n321' install-plugin cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source
sudo service Jenkin restart

4 July 2023
Jenkins file is a template where we put instructions + template + pipiline

jenkins file - Build agent, stages and steps / mutistage pipeline 
only type name jenkinsfile - vs code know about it / stages have two or more stage

pipeline from jenkins UI for deployment also just copy-paste the code
