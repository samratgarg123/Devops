kubectl - just like the docker command to perform anything on Kubernetes 
Kubernetes = container(docker) + orchestration (ansible)
os kernel is used to mana

kubectl get nodes - it is used to find number of nodes in the cluster/ info of the cluster
kubectl get nodes -o wide - to find flavor and version of Operating System on which the Kubernetes nodes

2. Kubernetes Concepts 
Pod - Kubernetes object (smallest object of kubernetes ), it is present inside the node of Kubernetes cluster 
To scale the applcation add new pods and vice verse not to add a new Kubernetes node 

How to create a pod 
kubectl run nginx(name of pod) --image nginx (--image nginx take image from docker hub of nginx)
kubectl delete pod webapp to delete the pod
kubectl edit pod redis - to edit pod image or name 

kubectl get pods - To list the pods available 
kubectl describe pod nginx - to provide more info of pod in detail
kubectl get pods -o wide - give info on node in a concise manner

Yaml in simple manner (data in yaml is present in key:value pair form)
